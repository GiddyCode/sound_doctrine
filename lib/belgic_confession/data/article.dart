      content:
          "We all believe in our hearts and confess with our mouths that there is a single and simple spiritual being, whom we call God -- eternal, incomprehensible, invisible, unchangeable, infinite, almighty; completely wise, just, and good, and the overflowing source of all good.",

      content:
          "We know him by two means:\n\nFirst, by the creation, preservation, and government of the universe, since that universe is before our eyes like a beautiful book in which all creatures, great and small, are as letters to make us ponder the invisible things of God: his eternal power and his divinity, as the apostle Paul says in Romans 1:20.\n\nAll these things are enough to convict men and to leave them without excuse.\n\nSecond, he makes himself known to us more openly by his holy and divine Word, as much as we need in this life, for his glory and for the salvation of his own.",

      content:
          "We confess that this Word of God was not sent nor delivered by the will of men, but that holy men of God spoke, being moved by the Holy Spirit, as Peter says.\n\nAfterwards our God -- because of the special care he has for us and our salvation -- commanded his servants, the prophets and apostles, to commit this revealed Word to writing.  He himself wrote with his own finger the two tables of the law.\n\nTherefore we call such writings holy and divine Scriptures.",

      title: "Article 4: The Canonical Books",
      content:
          "We include in the Holy Scripture the two volumes of the Old and New Testaments.  They are canonical books with which there can be no quarrel at all.\n\nIn the church of God the list is as follows: In the Old Testament, the five books of Moses -- Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy; the books of Joshua, Judges, and Ruth; the two books of Samuel, and two of Kings; the two books of Chronicles, called Paralipomenon; the first book of Ezra; Nehemiah, Esther, Job; the Psalms of David; the three books of Solomon -- Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song; the four major prophets -- Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel; and then the other twelve minor prophets -- Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi.\n\nIn the New Testament, the four gospels -- Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John; the Acts of the Apostles; the fourteen letters of Paul -- to the Romans; the two letters to the Corinthians; to the Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians the two letters to the Thessalonians; the two letters to Timothy; to Titus, Philemon, and to the Hebrews; the seven letters of the other apostles -- one of James; two of Peter; three of John; one of Jude; and the Revelation of the apostle John.",

      title: "Article 5: The Authority of Scripture",
      content:
          "We receive all these books and these only as holy and canonical, for the regulating, founding, and establishing of our faith.\n\nAnd we believe without a doubt all things contained in them -- not so much because the church receives and approves them as such but above all because the Holy Spirit testifies in our hearts that they are from God, and also because they prove themselves to be from God.\n\nFor even the blind themselves are able to see that the things predicted in them do happen.",

      title: "Article 6: The Difference Between Canonical and Apocryphal Books",
      content:
          "We distinguish between these holy books and the apocryphal ones, which are the third and fourth books of Esdras; the books of Tobit, Judith, Wisdom, Jesus Sirach, Baruch; what was added to the Story of Esther; the Song of the Three Children in the Furnace; the Story of Susannah; the Story of Bell and the Dragon; the Prayer of Manasseh; and the two books of Maccabees.\n\nThe church may certainly read these books and learn from them as far as they agree with the canonical books.  But they do not have such power and virtue that one could confirm from their testimony any point of faith or of the Christian religion.  Much less can they detract from the authority of the other holy books.",

      title: "Article 7: The Sufficiency of Scripture",
      content:
          "We believe that this Holy Scripture contains the will of God completely and that everything one must believe to be saved is sufficiently taught in it. For since the entire manner of service which God requires of us is described in it at great length, no one -- even an apostle or an angel from heaven, as Paul says -- 2 ought to teach other than what the Holy Scriptures have already taught us.  For since it is forbidden to add to or subtract from the Word of God, 3 this plainly demonstrates that the teaching is perfect and complete in all respects.\n\nTherefore we must not consider human writings -- no matter how holy their authors may have been -- equal to the divine writings; nor may we put custom, nor the majority, nor age, nor the passage of time or persons, nor councils, decrees, or official decisions above the truth of God, for truth is above everything else.\n\nFor all human beings are liars by nature and more vain than vanity itself.\n\nTherefore we reject with all our hearts everything that does not agree with this infallible rule, as we are taught to do by the apostles when they say, \"Test the spirits to see if they are of God,\" and also, \"If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house.\"",
