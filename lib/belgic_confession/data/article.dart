          "We all believe in our hearts and confess with our mouths that there is a single and simple spiritual being, whom we call God -- eternal, incomprehensible, invisible, unchangeable, infinite, almighty; completely wise, just, and good, and the overflowing source of all good.",

      content:
          "We know him by two means:\n\nFirst, by the creation, preservation, and government of the universe, since that universe is before our eyes like a beautiful book in which all creatures, great and small, are as letters to make us ponder the invisible things of God: his eternal power and his divinity, as the apostle Paul says in Romans 1:20.\n\nAll these things are enough to convict men and to leave them without excuse.\n\nSecond, he makes himself known to us more openly by his holy and divine Word, as much as we need in this life, for his glory and for the salvation of his own.",

      content:
          "We confess that this Word of God was not sent nor delivered by the will of men, but that holy men of God spoke, being moved by the Holy Spirit, as Peter says.\n\nAfterwards our God -- because of the special care he has for us and our salvation -- commanded his servants, the prophets and apostles, to commit this revealed Word to writing.  He himself wrote with his own finger the two tables of the law.\n\nTherefore we call such writings holy and divine Scriptures.",

      content:
          "We include in the Holy Scripture the two volumes of the Old and New Testaments.  They are canonical books with which there can be no quarrel at all.\n\nIn the church of God the list is as follows: In the Old Testament, the five books of Moses -- Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy; the books of Joshua, Judges, and Ruth; the two books of Samuel, and two of Kings; the two books of Chronicles, called Paralipomenon; the first book of Ezra; Nehemiah, Esther, Job; the Psalms of David; the three books of Solomon -- Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song; the four major prophets -- Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel; and then the other twelve minor prophets -- Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi.\n\nIn the New Testament, the four gospels -- Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John; the Acts of the Apostles; the fourteen letters of Paul -- to the Romans; the two letters to the Corinthians; to the Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians the two letters to the Thessalonians; the two letters to Timothy; to Titus, Philemon, and to the Hebrews; the seven letters of the other apostles -- one of James; two of Peter; three of John; one of Jude; and the Revelation of the apostle John.",

      content:
          "We receive all these books and these only as holy and canonical, for the regulating, founding, and establishing of our faith.\n\nAnd we believe without a doubt all things contained in them -- not so much because the church receives and approves them as such but above all because the Holy Spirit testifies in our hearts that they are from God, and also because they prove themselves to be from God.\n\nFor even the blind themselves are able to see that the things predicted in them do happen.",

      content:
          "We distinguish between these holy books and the apocryphal ones, which are the third and fourth books of Esdras; the books of Tobit, Judith, Wisdom, Jesus Sirach, Baruch; what was added to the Story of Esther; the Song of the Three Children in the Furnace; the Story of Susannah; the Story of Bell and the Dragon; the Prayer of Manasseh; and the two books of Maccabees.\n\nThe church may certainly read these books and learn from them as far as they agree with the canonical books.  But they do not have such power and virtue that one could confirm from their testimony any point of faith or of the Christian religion.  Much less can they detract from the authority of the other holy books.",

      title: "Article 7: The Sufficiency of Scripture",
      content:
          "We believe that this Holy Scripture contains the will of God completely and that everything one must believe to be saved is sufficiently taught in it. For since the entire manner of service which God requires of us is described in it at great length, no one -- even an apostle or an angel from heaven, as Paul says -- 2 ought to teach other than what the Holy Scriptures have already taught us.  For since it is forbidden to add to or subtract from the Word of God, 3 this plainly demonstrates that the teaching is perfect and complete in all respects.\n\nTherefore we must not consider human writings -- no matter how holy their authors may have been -- equal to the divine writings; nor may we put custom, nor the majority, nor age, nor the passage of time or persons, nor councils, decrees, or official decisions above the truth of God, for truth is above everything else.\n\nFor all human beings are liars by nature and more vain than vanity itself.\n\nTherefore we reject with all our hearts everything that does not agree with this infallible rule, as we are taught to do by the apostles when they say, \"Test the spirits to see if they are of God,\" and also, \"If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house.\"",

      title: "Article 8: The Trinity",
      content:
          "In keeping with this truth and Word of God we believe in one God, who is one single essence, in whom there are three persons, really, truly, and eternally distinct according to their incommunicable properties -- namely, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  The Father is the cause, origin, and source of all things, visible as well as invisible.\nnThe Son is the Word, the Wisdom, and the image of the Father.\nnThe Holy Spirit is the eternal power and might, proceeding from the Father and the Son.\nnNevertheless, this distinction does not divide God into three, since Scripture teaches us that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit each has his own subsistence distinguished by characteristics -- yet in such a way that these three persons are only one God.\nnIt is evident then that the Father is not the Son and that the Son is not the Father, and that likewise the Holy Spirit is neither the Father nor the Son.\nnNevertheless, these persons, thus distinct, are neither divided nor fused or mixed together.\nnFor the Father did not take on flesh, nor did the Spirit, but only the Son.\nnThe Father was never without his Son, nor without his Holy Spirit, since all these are equal from eternity, in one and the same essence.\nnThere is neither a first nor a last, for all three are one in truth and power, in goodness and mercy.",

      title: "Article 9: The Scriptural Witness on the Trinity",
      content:
          "All these things we know from the testimonies of Holy Scripture as well as from the effects of the persons, especially from those we feel within ourselves.\n\nThe testimonies of the Holy Scriptures, which teach us to believe in this Holy Trinity, are written in many places of the Old Testament, which need not be enumerated but only chosen with discretion.\n\nIn the book of Genesis God says, \”Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness.\”  So \”God created man in his own image\” -- indeed, \”male and female he created them.\”  \”Behold, man has become like one of us.\”\n\nIt appears from this that there is a plurality of persons within the Deity, when he says, \”Let us make man in our image\” -- and afterwards he indicates the unity when he says, \”God created.\”\n\nIt is true that he does not say here how many persons there are -- but what is somewhat obscure to us in the Old Testament is very clear in the New.\n\nFor when our Lord was baptized in the Jordan, the voice of the Father was heard saying, \”This is my dear Son\”;  the Son was seen in the water; and the Holy Spirit appeared in the form of a dove.\n\nSo, in the baptism of all believers this form was prescribed by Christ: \”Baptize all people in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.\”\n\nIn the Gospel according to Luke the angel Gabriel says to Mary, the mother of our Lord: \”The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and therefore that holy one to be born of you shall be called the Son of God.\”\n\nAnd in another place it says: \”The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you.\”\n\n\”There are three who bear witness in heaven -- the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit -- and these three are one.\”\n\nIn all these passages we are fully taught that there are three persons in the one and only divine essence.  And although this doctrine surpasses human understanding, we nevertheless believe it now, through the Word, waiting to know and enjoy it fully in heaven.\n\nFurthermore, we must note the particular works and activities of these three persons in relation to us.  The Father is called our Creator, by reason of his power.  The Son is our Savior and Redeemer, by his blood.  The Holy Spirit is our Sanctifier, by his living in our hearts.\n\nThis doctrine of the holy Trinity has always been maintained in the true church, from the time of the apostles until the present, against Jews, Muslims, and certain false Christians and heretics, such as Marcion, Mani, Praxeas, Sabellius, Paul of Samosata, Arius, and others like them, who were rightly condemned by the holy fathers.\n\nAnd so, in this matter we willingly accept the three ecumenical creeds -- the Apostles', Nicene, and Athanasian -- as well as what the ancient fathers decided in agreement with them.\n\nGen. 1:26-27;   Gen. 3:22;   Matt. 3:17;   Matt. 28:19;   Luke 1:35;  2 Cor. 13:14;  1 John 5:7 ",
